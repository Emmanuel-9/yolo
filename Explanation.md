### Backend Dockerfile
The backend Dockerfile defines the image for the server-side application. Here's a breakdown of what the file does:
```
* FROM node:14: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image, in this case, the official  Node.js 14 image from Docker Hub.
* WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory for the image to /app.
* COPY package*.json ./: This line copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the /app directory in the Docker image.
* RUN npm install: This line installs the Node.js dependencies for the server-side application.
* COPY . .: This line copies the entire contents of the current directory (the server-side application code) to the /app directory in the Docker image.
* EXPOSE 5000: This line exposes port 5000 for the server-side application.
* CMD ["npm", "start"]: This line specifies the command that should be run when the Docker image is started, in this case, running the npm start command to start the server-side application.
```
### Client Dockerfile
The client Dockerfile defines the image for the client-side application. Here's a breakdown of what the file does:
```
* FROM node:14: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image, in this case, the official Node.js 14 image from Docker Hub.
* WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory for the image to /app.
* COPY package*.json ./: This line copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the /app directory in the Docker image.
* RUN npm install: This line installs the Node.js dependencies for the client-side application.
* COPY . .: This line copies the entire contents of the current directory (the client-side application code) to the /app directory in the Docker image.
* EXPOSE 3000: This line exposes port 3000 for the client-side application.
* CMD ["npm", "start"]: This line specifies the command that should be run when the Docker image is started, in this case, running the npm start command to start the client-side application.

```

### Docker compose file
In this Docker Compose file, we define three services: frontend, backend, and mongo. The frontend and backend services are based on the custom images while the mongo service uses the official mongo image.

We map the respective ports of the containers running the frontend, backend, and mongo services. This allows us to access the YOLO application from our web browser and to communicate with the backend service.

The frontend service depends on the backend and mongo services, and the backend service depends on the mongo service. This ensures that the services start up in the right order, with the mongo service being available first.

We use the network to connect the three services. This allows them to communicate with each other using their service names (e.g., the frontend service can communicate with the backend service at the address http://backend:5000). We also use a Docker volume called mongo-data to persist the Mongo data.
